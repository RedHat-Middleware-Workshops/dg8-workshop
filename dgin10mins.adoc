=== A Full Lifecycle Operator to reduce deployment and management overhead in OpenShift
An Operator enables the operations and lifecycle management for an application by using the underlying Kubernetes APIs. This means that complex applications e.g., consumed as services such as distributed caching, databases, etc. can easily get upgraded when newer versions arrive and more; also meaning no human intervention. The Operator SDK enables developers to write such Operators. Red Hat Data Grid 8.0 introduces a fully supported Data Grid Operator that provides operational intelligence.

With the latest release of Red Hat Data Grid, now you can also use it with an Operator. 

Try some of the following documentation to create a Data Grid Operator subscription and get running in OpenShift:

=== A new server architecture 
Cloud and Container Native Data Grid needs to be a reduced footprint, and that's what the latest version of Red Hat Data Grid brings. It reduces both the disk footprint and initial heap size upto 50%, leaving more memory for your data. You can now run the server without the Red Hat JBoss Enterprise Application Platform (EAP), ensuring a lower memory and disk footprint
also simplifies configuration. 

Moreover, Data Grid 8.0 servers provide several enhancements and improvements to security, including integration with Red Hat SSO and a smaller attack surface.

=== A more performant and rich REST API 
Red Hat Data Grid 8.0 introduces REST API v2. 
The API is with 50% faster response rates compared to v1. There are also new capabilities introduced such as
Now you can access data and manipulate objects such as counters.
Perform operations such as gracefully shutting down Data Grid clusters or transferring cache state to backup locations when using cross-site replication.
And lastly, Monitor cluster and server health and retrieve statistics.
Moreover, Red Hat Data Grid REST API v2 also automatically converts between storage formats such as JSON, XML, Protobuf, and plain text for increased interoperability. The Red Hat Data Grid engineering team develop and maintain comprehensive REST API Documentation


=== A powerful CLI 
In 8.0, Data Grid gives you a new CLI with intuitive commands for remotely accessing data and managing clusters.
The CLI uses familiar Bash commands for navigating, such as cd and ls. It also provides command history and auto-completion for ease of use. 

Additionally, the CLI provides help text and man pages for commands with clear examples.

Try the docs: Getting Started with the Data Grid CLI.

=== Enhanced observability 
Now you can use the /metrics endpoint for integration with Prometheus. Moreover, Red Hat Data Grid 8 is also compatible with Eclipse Microprofile Metrics API. More specific metrics and gauges are included. For more details, check the documentation here. Data Grid 8.0 also offers improved statistics and management operations via JMX and updates to logging with coarse-grained logging categories and support for logs in JSON format.



=== Using Red Hat Data Grid
==== As a data grid
You can use Red Hat Data Grid as your primary store and use its powerful features such as transactions, notifications, queries, distributed execution, distributed streams, analytics to process data quickly.

==== As a clustering building block for your applications
If you need to make your application cluster-aware, integrate Red Hat Data Grid and get access to features like topology change notifications, cluster communication and clustered execution.

==== As a geographical backup for your data
Red Hat Data Grid supports replication between clusters, allowing you to backup your data across geographically remote sites.
