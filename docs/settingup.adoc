== First Step: Confirm Your Username!

Look in the box at the top of your screen. Is your username set already? If so it will look like this:

image::alreadyset.png[Set User ID above, 700]

If your username is properly set, then you can move on. **If not, in the above box, enter the user ID you were assigned** like this:

image::setuser.png[Set User ID above, 700]

This will customize the links and copy/paste code for this workshop. If you accidentally type the wrong username, just click the green recycle icon to reset it.

Throughout this lab you'll discover how Quarkus can make your development of cloud native apps faster and more productive.

== Click-to-Copy

You will see various code and command blocks throughout these exercises which can be copy/pasted directly by clicking anywhere on the block of text:

[source,java,role="copypaste"]
----
/* A sample Java snippet that you can copy/paste by clicking */
public class CopyMeDirectly {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("You can copy this whole class with a click!");
    }
}
----

Simply click once and the whole block is copied to your clipboard, ready to be pasted with kbd:[CTRL+V] (or kbd:[Command+V] on Mac OS).

There are also Linux shell commands that can also be copied and pasted into a Terminal in your Development Environment:

[source,sh,role="copypaste"]
----
echo "This is a bash shell command that you can copy/paste by clicking"
----

== The Workshop Environment You Are Using

Your workshop environment consists of several components which have been pre-installed and are ready to use. Depending on which parts of the workshop you’re doing, you will use one or more of:

* https://www.openshift.com/[Red Hat OpenShift,window=_blank] - You’ll use one or more *projects* (Kubernetes namespaces) that are your own and are isolated from other workshop students
* https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-workspaces/overview[Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces,window=_blank] - based on *Eclipse Che*, it’s a cloud-based, in-browser IDE (similar to IntelliJ IDEA, VSCode, Eclipse IDE). You’ve been provisioned your own personal workspace for use with this workshop. You’ll write, test, and deploy code from here.
* https://www.redhat.com/en/products/runtimes[Red Hat Runtimes, window=_blank] - a collection of cloud-native runtimes and platform that enables Spring Boot, Node.js, and https://quarkus.io[Quarkus, window=_blank] developers to create Cloud-native apps with ease.

You’ll be provided clickable URLs throughout the workshop to access the services that have been installed for you.
