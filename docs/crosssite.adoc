=== Deployment: Geo Distributed Cache

Data Grid Operator in one data center can discover a Data Grid cluster that Data Grid Operator manages in another data center. This discovery allows Data Grid to automatically form cross-site views and create global clusters.

The following illustration provides an example in which Data Grid Operator manages a Data Grid cluster at a data center in New York City, NYC. At another data center in London, LON, Data Grid Operator also manages a Data Grid cluster.

Data Grid Operator uses the Kubernetes API to establish a secure connection between the OpenShift Container Platform clusters in NYC and LON. Data Grid Operator then creates a cross-site replication service so Data Grid clusters can back up data across locations.

Each Data Grid cluster has one site master node that coordinates all backup requests. Data Grid Operator identifies the site master node so that all traffic through the cross-site replication service goes to the site master.

If the current site master node goes offline then a new node becomes site master. Data Grid Operator automatically finds the new site master node and updates the cross-site replication service to forward backup requests to it.

In our case since this is a lab, we will not make use of two different clusters, but to understand how this works, we will use two different namespaces. 
The concepts will be very much similar. Although this might make for a a great showcase, its a very unique usecase to use Cross-site replication in two namespaces. 
We will use two projects/namespaces

<1> {{ USER_ID }}-cache - Site (NYC)
<2> {{ USER_ID }}-cache2 - Site (LON)


Open the `OpenShift` console with the link:{{ CONSOLE_URL }}[OpenShift web console^]

Choose the project {{ USER_ID }}-cache

And create new Data Grid instance by Navigating to `Installed Operators > Data Grid > Create Infinispan ` as the following pictures shows

image::create-infinispan.png[Cross site - Topology, 700]

Press the buttone `Create Infinispan`

First we will create a new Infinispan cluster for our NYC location in the {{ USER_ID }}-cache

image::xsite-nyc-yaml.png[Cross site - Topology, 700]

Load the below yaml and press `Create` as shown in the picture above ^

[source, yaml, role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: infinispan.org/v1
kind: Infinispan
metadata:
  name: example-nyc
spec:
  replicas: 2
  logging:
    categories:
      org.jgroups.protocols.TCP: error
      org.jgroups.protocols.relay.RELAY2: error
  service:
    container:
      storage: 1Gi
    sites:
      local:
        expose:
          type: ClusterIP
        name: NYC
      locations:
        - clusterName: example-lon
          name: LON
          namespace: {{ USER_ID }}-cache2
          secretName: lon-token
          url: 'infinispan+xsite://example-lon-site.{{ USER_ID }}-cache2.svc:7900'    
    type: DataGrid
----


And lets the the same for our LON site in project `{{ USER_ID }}-cache2`

image::xsite-lon-yaml.png[Cross site - Topology, 700]

Load the below yaml and press `Create` as shown in the picture above ^


[source, yaml, role="copypaste"]
----
apiVersion: infinispan.org/v1
kind: Infinispan
metadata:
  name: example-lon
spec:
  replicas: 2
  logging:
    categories:
      org.jgroups.protocols.TCP: error
      org.jgroups.protocols.relay.RELAY2: error
  service:
    container:
      storage: 1Gi
    sites:
      local:
        expose:
          type: ClusterIP
        name: LON
      locations:
        - clusterName: example-nyc
          name: NYC
          namespace: {{ USER_ID }}-cache
          secretName: lon-token
          url: 'infinispan+xsite://example-nyc-site.{{ USER_ID }}-cache.svc:7900'    
    type: DataGrid

Once the cluster starts to provision via the Operator you should see it listed as follows

image::xsite-nyc-screenshot.png[Cross site - Topology, 700]

Click on the cluster name and then click on `YAML`
This should give you the details of the CR but also most importantly the status

image::xsite-nyc-status-yaml.png[Cross site - Topology, 700]


Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the yaml and check the status tag; should look similar to the following `YAML`

[source, yaml, role="copypaste"]
----
status:
  conditions:
    - status: 'True'
      type: PreliminaryChecksPassed
    - message: 'View: example-nyc-0-63972,example-nyc-1-45654'
      status: 'True'
      type: WellFormed
    - message: 'Cross-Site view: LON'
      status: 'True'
      type: CrossSiteViewFormed
  podStatus:
    ready:
      - example-nyc-1
      - example-nyc-2
  statefulSetName: example-nyc
