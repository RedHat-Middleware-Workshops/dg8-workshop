== Conclusion
:experimental:

You made it ! Or you jumped to this section. Anyway, congratulations. We hope you enjoy this lab and learn some
_stuff_. There is many other things about Red Hat Data Grid and Infinispan that you can do and that was not illustrated here.

Don't forget Red Hat Data Grid can be used in many usecases:

* Red Hat Data Grid is a Cloud native caching system that you can embed in your application or use it as a remote server
* You can use it with the some of the well known frameworks and runtimes like Java, Node, C, C# etc. 
* And it intergrates very well with Kubernetes/Openshift e.g. Operators, Observability etc.

As soon as you jump into the microservice, functions or cloud native applications, you will need a better application environment. Kubernetes/OpenShift are perfect weapon to build, deploy, bind, and manage your microservices.
