= REST API
:experimental:

The Data Grid REST API allows you to monitor, maintain, and manage Data Grid deployments and provides access to your data.
Although the REST API has a vast amount of features that one can use, in our lab we will demonstrate only some of them.
For more details on the documentation on the Red Hat Data Grid REST API please visit the documentation page.
Infinispan servers provide RESTful HTTP access to data through a REST endpoint built on Netty.

=== Supported Formats
You can write and read data in different formats and Data Grid can convert between those formats when required.

The following "standard" formats are interchangeable:

- `application/x-java-object`
- `application/octet-stream`
- `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
- `text/plain`

We are using this example from the very good lists of demo collection on github: https://github.com/infinispan-demos/links
We will do the following

. Create a Cache in Infinispan with Lucene support
. Define our protostream
. Load bulk data into the cache
. Use search queries directly into the cache

Let's get started!

== The Pokeman Example

=== What is a Pokemon?
Reminiscences from the GameBoy the creatures that inhabit the world of Pokémon are also called Pokémon. Many species of Pokémon are capable of evolving into a larger and more powerful creatures. The change is accompanied by stat changes, generally a modest increase, and access to a wider variety of attacks. There are multiple ways to trigger an evolution, including reaching a particular level, using a special stone, or learning a specific attack. For example, at level 16 Bulbasaur is capable of evolving into Ivysaur. Most notably, the Normal-type Eevee is capable of evolving into eight different Pokémon: Jolteon (Electric), Flareon (Fire), Vaporeon (Water), Umbreon (Dark), Espeon (Psychic), Leafeon (Grass), Glaceon (Ice), and Sylveon (Fairy). In Generation VI, a new mechanic called Mega Evolution—as well as a subset of Mega Evolution called Primal Reversion—was introduced into the game. Unlike normal evolution, Mega Evolution and Primal Reversion last only for the duration of a battle, with the Pokémon reverting to its normal form at the end. Forty-eight Pokémon are capable of undergoing Mega Evolution or Primal Reversion as of the release of Sun and Moon. In contrast, some species such as Castform, Rotom, Unown, and Lycanroc undergo form changes that may provide stat buffs or changes and type alterations but are not considered new species. Some Pokémon have differences in appearance due to gender. Pokémon can be male or female, male-only, female-only, or genderless.

=== Setup

All the project sources are in the project `dg8-restapi`. We will be using the `curl` utility as well as our browser.

Let's open up a new terminal in the CodeReady workspace. Make sure you are logged into OpenShift.

Run the following command on the terminal which will get the password for user developer and store it in and environment variable.
[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
export PASSWORD=$(oc get secret datagrid-service-generated-secret -o jsonpath="{.data.identities\.yaml}" | base64 --decode | awk 'NR==3' | awk '{print $2}')
----

We are using the same service we created from the operator in previous labs.

We will also need our `LoadBalancer` address to reach the datagrid server. You can do that by running the following command in the terminal, which will set the `LoadBalancer` address to $LB in the terminal.

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
export LB="http://$(oc get services | grep datagrid-service-external | awk '{ print $4 }'):11222"
----

[IMPORTANT]
====
At anytime if you close the terminal, you will need to run these two commands again!
====

=== First let's register our protobuf

Let's see whats our data structure looks like.

[source, properties, role="copypaste"]
----
/**
  * @Indexed
  */
message Pokemon  {
  repeated string abilities = 1;
  optional float against_bug = 2;
  optional float against_dark = 3;
  optional float against_dragon = 4;
  optional float against_electric = 5;
  optional float against_fairy = 6;
  optional float against_fight = 7;
  optional float against_fire = 8;
  optional float against_flying = 9;
  optional float against_ghost = 10;
  optional float against_grass = 11;
  optional float against_ground = 12;
  optional float against_ice = 13;
  optional float against_normal = 14;
  optional float against_poison = 15;
  optional float against_psychic = 16;
  optional float against_rock = 17;
  optional float against_steel = 18;
  optional float against_water = 19;
  optional float attack = 20;
  optional float base_egg_steps = 21;
  optional float base_happiness = 22;
  optional float base_total = 23;
  optional string capture_rate = 24;

  /* @Field(index=Index.YES, analyze = Analyze.YES, store = Store.NO) */
  optional string classfication = 25;
  optional float defense = 26;
  optional float experience_growth = 27;
  optional float height_m = 28;
  optional float hp = 29;

  /* @Field(index=Index.YES, analyze = Analyze.YES, store = Store.NO) */
  optional string japanese_name = 30;

  /* @Field(index=Index.YES, analyze = Analyze.YES, store = Store.NO) */
  optional string name = 31;
  optional float percentage_male = 32;
  optional float pokedex_number = 33;
  optional float sp_attack = 34;
  optional float sp_defense = 35;
  optional float speed = 36;

  /* @Field(index=Index.YES, analyze = Analyze.YES, store = Store.NO) */
  optional string type1 = 37;
  optional string type2 = 38;
  optional float weight_kg = 39;
  optional float generation = 40;
  optional float is_legendary = 41;
}

----

In our project `dg8-restapi` open the file `pokemon.proto` and paste the above data structure. The structure defines the capabilities of a Pokemon.

When caches are indexed, or specifically configured to store `application/x-protostream`, you can send and receive JSON documents that are automatically converted to and from Protostream. In order for this conversion to work you must register a protobuf schema.

First let's cd into the current project

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
cd $CHE_PROJECTS_ROOT/dg8-workshop-labs/dg8-restapi
----

To register protobuf schemas via REST, invoke a POST or PUT in the `___protobuf_metadata` cache as in the following command

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
curl --digest -u developer:$PASSWORD -X POST --data-binary @./pokemon.proto $LB/rest/v2/caches/___protobuf_metadata/pokemon.proto
----



=== Create a Cache

Now let's create an indexed cache since we want to retrieve data at speed from our Cache and Lucene store.

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
curl --digest -u developer:$PASSWORD -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"distributed-cache":{"mode":"SYNC","indexing":{"auto-config":true,"index":"ALL"}}}' $LB/rest/v2/caches/pokemon
----

=== Bulk loading the REST endpoint
Now we will load all the pokemon data we have in a json format. You can view the json files in `dg8-restapi/data`

for Example Abra's capabilities listed as follows

[source, json, role="copypaste"]
----
{
    "_type": "Pokemon",
    "abilities": "['Synchronize', 'Inner Focus', 'Magic Guard']",
    "against_bug": 2.0,
    "against_dark": 2.0,
    "against_dragon": 1.0,
    "against_electric": 1.0,
    "against_fairy": 1.0,
    "against_fight": 0.5,
    "against_fire": 1.0,
    "against_flying": 1.0,
    "against_ghost": 2.0,
    "against_grass": 1.0,
    "against_ground": 1.0,
    "against_ice": 1.0,
    "against_normal": 1.0,
    "against_poison": 1.0,
    "against_psychic": 0.5,
    "against_rock": 1.0,
    "against_steel": 1.0,
    "against_water": 1.0,
    "attack": 20.0,
    "base_egg_steps": 5120.0,
    "base_happiness": 70.0,
    "base_total": 310.0,
    "capture_rate": 200.0,
    "classfication": "Psi Pok\u00e9mon",
    "defense": 15.0,
    "experience_growth": 1059860.0,
    "height_m": 0.9,
    "hp": 25.0,
    "japanese_name": "Casey\u30b1\u30fc\u30b7\u30a3",
    "name": "Abra",
    "percentage_male": 75.4,
    "pokedex_number": 63.0,
    "sp_attack": 105.0,
    "sp_defense": 55.0,
    "speed": 90.0,
    "type1": "psychic",
    "type2": 0,
    "weight_kg": 19.5,
    "generation": 1.0,
    "is_legendary": 0.0
}

----


Let's run our loading script which is placed in our project `dg8-restapi`. Run the shell script in the terminal

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
./ingest-data.sh
----

[NOTE]
====
The script run can take some time, wait for it to finish.
====

So by now we should have loaded about 801 Pokemon's from the Pokemon universe.

So what does the script look like?
Below you can se that we are loading each of the json files one by one to the cache rest end point

[source, shell, role="copypaste"]
----
status=0
for f in data/*.json
do
  curl --digest -u developer:$PASSWORD -XPOST --data-binary @${f}  -H "Content-Type: application/json; charset=UTF-8"  $LB/rest/v2/caches/pokemon/$(basename $f .json)
  let status=status+1
  echo  "Imported $f (total $status pokemons)"
done
----

=== Query the data

Get all Pokemons:

[source, url, role="copypaste"]
----
curl --digest -u developer:$PASSWORD $LB/rest/v2/caches/pokemon'?action=search&query=from%20Pokemon'
----

Count Pokemons by generation:

[source, url, role="copypaste"]
----
# select count(p.name) from Pokemon group by generation
curl --digest -u developer:$PASSWORD $LB/rest/v2/caches/pokemon'?action=search&query=select%20count(p.name)%20from%20Pokemon%20p%20group%20by%20generation'
----

Do a full text search on the name

[source, url, role="copypaste"]
----
curl --digest -u developer:$PASSWORD $LB/rest/v2/caches/pokemon'?action=search&query=from%20Pokemon%20where%20name:%27pikachu%27'
----

Select top 5 Pokemons that can better withstand fire:

[source, url, role="copypaste"]
----
curl --digest -u developer:$PASSWORD $LB/rest/v2/caches/pokemon'?action=search&query=from%20Pokemon%20order%20by%20against_fire%20asc&max_results=5'
----

Get Pokemon by key (name)

[source, url, role="copypaste"]
----
curl --digest -u developer:$PASSWORD $LB/rest/v2/caches/pokemon/Whismur
----


=== Recap

. You how the REST API works
. You created a cache and protobuf via REST API
. You loaded bulk data into the cache
