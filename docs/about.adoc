:experimental:

You are a *developer* or an architect creating world-class applications and solutions. Well, all apps don't necessarily live in just one box, and for the recent past, Cloud is not only just a bunch of machines in a server room but a lot more that gives us the ability to hyper scale. All applications must use a network to communicate with each other, whether they connect to a database, a web service or storage, or other services. 

Creating a distributed application means one has to take specials care of latency, performance, and, most importantly, the responsiveness to the end-users. End users could be systems or humans; what's important is that you have a timely and consistent response. There are a lot many things one can do to optimize the stack. Most importantly, this workshop focuses on one thing i.e., Red Hat Data Grid.

What is Red Hat Data Grid? 
Red Hat Data Grid 8.2 provides a distributed in-memory, NoSQL datastore solution. Your applications can access, process, and analyze data at in-memory speed to deliver a superior user experience. Whether you are using legacy applications or a new breed of microservices and functions, Red Hat Data Grid 8.2 will enable your applications to perform better with its in-memory solution. 

This lab offers attendees an intro-level, hands-on session with Red Hat Data Grid. From the first line of code to building & consuming services and finally to assembling everything and deploying it on Openshift. It illustrates what a Cache is, how to build applications with a distributed cache, as well as best practices on designing applications with caching in mind.

Deploying and maintaining microservices can become challenging. There are many elements of software design one needs to ensure in constructing and maintaining distributed services. To help us deploy our microservices we are going to use Openshift, a Kubernetes distribution from Red Hat. Kubernetes (commonly referred to as "K8s") is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications that was originally designed by Google and donated to the Cloud Native Computing Foundation. It aims to provide a "platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts". In this workshop, we are using a specific distribution of K8s named OpenShift that provide a few sets of features beneficial to maintain our microservices. We use OpenShift in this lab because of the complexity involved when dealing with multiple microservices, their updates, downtimes, and so on.

This is a BYOB (Bring Your Own Browser) session. You will be provided with a CodeReady Workspace, an Openshift environment all pre-provisioned. If you prefer to run locally on your laptop, you can do development on your laptop. Just keep in mind that all instructions are designed to run with CodeReady workspaces i.e. browser based. If you decide to run locally on your laptop you need JDK 11 and Apache Maven (3.5+).

What you are going to learn:

 * What is Red Hat Data Grid 8.2
 * What is a Cache, and how to start with the common use cases
 * What is Clustering in a Cache scenario and how it works
 * Working with the Data Grid 8.2 Operator
 * Monitoring and metrics
 * What is a Remote Cache and how to take benefit of it within Red Hat Data Grid
 * Operations with the Data Grid Operator, creating Cache, Backup, restores etc.
 * How to build applications with known frameworks like Quarkus and Spring
